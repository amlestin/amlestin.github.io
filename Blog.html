		<h4> Marketing is undeniably a crucial factor in the business world. Marketing is a set of activities for creating something of value for stakeholders. Communication, exchanging, and delivery of goods are basic components in marketing.  There are four marketing philosophies:  production orientation, sales orientation, market orientation, and societal orientation. Production orientation is centred around the phrase "if you make it, it will sell." Sales orientation is utilised by aggressive selling techniques or tactics. For example: clearance sales, huge discounts up to 90% to increase sales revenue. Market orientation focuses on consumer's needs. On the other hand, societal orientation is more of an extension of market orientation. It does not contradict market orientation but instead it provides a bigger scope of the marketing side. Societal orientation encompasses the environment and society, making it broader. </h4>

		<h4> The advancement of technology has improved marketing tactics and strategy by leaps and bounds. The emergence of the Internet in the late 60's has changed how businesses market their products or services. Furthermore, the invention of fast computers, smart devices has improved made businesses expand and boom exponentially. Beyond the shadow of doubt, the elements of the marketing mix have been greatly influenced by technology. The elements of the marketing mix are product, price, promotion, and place. Technology has linked all four of the marketing mix together and made it easier for firms and consumers alike to reap the benefits of competition between businesses. </h4>

		<h4> An article by Bob Liodice clearly illustrates the fact that technology is undeniably important for marketers. The advent of social media is perhaps the most pivotal factor in increasing consumer use of products by businesses. Social media has increased the competitiveness of businesses, giving consumers a higher bargaining power. Besides, search engine optimizations are also one of the most vital and cost-effective way to attract customers. According to the article by Liodice, almost two-thirds of the time, people look only at the first page of their search results. This leads to a more targeted lead for the advertiser and easier search process for the consumer. Marketing not only includes selling products, it also takes consumer behaviour into account. With technology improving at a rapid pace, huge firms collect data from search histories or engines. With the data collected, firms use interest-based advertising. Behavioural targeting allows ads to be more relevant, valuable, and more persuasive to the consumer. Also, online video streaming services like Hulu, Netflix, and YouTube are helping to promote brand names indirectly. Due to the Internet's low distribution costs and built-in sharing capabilities, brands have been eager to produce the next viral hit. Mobile advertising and payments are expected to worth more than $1.56 billion due to the surge of smart devices in the past few years. Tech giants such as Samsung, Google, Apple have their own versions of smart devices that help made our lives easier. Consumers increasingly look to their phones to aid in more aspects of their lives. Giant companies such as Samsung and Apple have even developed services such as SamsungPay and AppleWallet, creating the convenience of buying something even without having your wallet on you. </h4>

		<h4> Technology helps process massive amounts of data that can't be done by humans. With the data collected, marketers are able to make a decision on which marketing strategy to use for optimising the exposure of their products to consumers. Before advertising their products, marketers have to decide a target market. With the technological advancement available, marketers can segment the market according to which groups they are trying to target. By using specific software and applications, firms can easily segment the markets they are interested in. Online ads were used to be priced at the amount of exposure gained; however, with technology, a new model called the ԣost-per-clickԠmodel is used instead. Marketers take advantage of the Internetӳ ability to measure user action and use that to see a clearer picture of the return of investment (ROI). </h4>

		<h4> We have improved our technology so much that information is available to everyone with just a simple click or touch away. The Internet has provided firms with a great platform to sell their products. I agreed with Liodice about how technology is irreplaceable now to business. It provides consumers with a variety of goods and services. I think the best part of having advance technology is how people can connect with other people around the globe. Technology has played a significant role in globalisation. Trends, culture, and news are now accessible from anywhere in the world. Knowing the culture and news that is happening around the world is really useful to target potential customers from that particular region. Social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram are great for marketing. People are more connected to each other on social media with websites like that; thus, making branding easier for companies. The option of sharing enables even more people to be exposed to the brand names. </h4>
		<br>
		<h4> With future technological advances, marketing will be more accessible and easier. Businesses will be able to process and send out information faster to people so consumers can compare and make decisions with ease. </h4>
